      <h2>Senior Project - Agentic AI for Blue Teaming</h2>
      <p>Over my last semester, I will be doing research on ways Agentic AI can be used in cyber defense/blue teaming. In order to do this, I plan on testing AI's use of defesnive security tools in a controlled lab environment. This project is by no means complete, but I will be done by the time I graduate. More to come on this.</p>

      <p>This is my personal portfolio website, built with HTML, CSS, and a little JavaScript. It showcases my interests, resume, and interactive features like flipping cards. I plan on continuing to update and polish this website.</p>

      <p>This andriod/IOS mobile app uses React Native Expo and Typescript to allow users to access the content of Dr. Lisa Baker's "What's Next" book. As part of the Samford software development course, teams are given a client to build a project for during the semester. Our client was Dr. Baker, and her mission has been to help parents of children with illnesses navigate the hospitalization process. This app takes Dr. Baker's helpful tips and information and presents it in an easy to click through form. My personal contributions to this project include UI design and some of the app functionality. While the app is not yet available for users, some members of our team are continuing to work on finalizing it. I am unfortunately not able to assist with this due to a busy final semester, but I would love to see the What's Next app in the App Store and Play Store.</p>

      </p>
      <p>This project is a java automatic rock paper scissors game. There is a Java file that assigns players and teams and another that performs the games. The purpose of this project was to practice basic object oriented programming and to better help me understand Java.</p>
